GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE, BY ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
The indicator shows the amount of hazardous waste generated annually in the EU as a whole and in individual countries, expressed in kilos per inhabitant. It covers all waste classified as hazardous under the definition in the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC). Waste from all sectors of the economy, households and waste treatment (secondary waste) is included.

The indicator is based on data collected in the way stipulated by the Waste Statistics Regulation. It is available for every second year after the reference year, 2004.

Municipal waste consists of waste collected by or on behalf of municipal authorities, or directly by the private sector (business or private non-profit institutions) not on behalf of municipalities. The bulk of the waste stream originates from households, though similar wastes from sources such as commerce, offices, public institutions and selected municipal services are also included. It also includes bulky waste but excludes waste from municipal sewage networks and municipal construction and demolition waste.

It is important to understand that the term â€˜municipal' is used in different ways reflecting different waste management practices. Differences between countries are to some extent the result of differences in the coverage of these similar wastes. Waste generation figures and management rates for municipal waste will therefore be influenced by the proportion of commercial waste, for example, which falls under the definition. It is not clear which countries are following which approach from the data available here, so caution is advised when making comparisons across the EU.

Generation of hazardous waste by economic activity
kg per capita
The indicator presents the amount of hazardous waste generated in the EU-28 and per Member State, expressed in kg per inhabitant and year. The indicator covers hazardous waste from all economic sectors and from households, including waste from waste treatment (secondary waste). The indicator covers all waste that is classified as hazardous according to the definition of the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC) and, accordingly, excludes radioactive waste.
